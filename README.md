In the realm of circuits, where electrons weave,  
Lies a magic, modern minds conceive.  
A dance of numbers, precise and keen,  
A symphony in code, a digital dream.  

From whispers in wires, a signal is born,  
A flicker of data, in twilight and morn.  
Machine learning awakens, with circuits entwined,  
To patterns and secrets, its logic confined.  

Neurons in silicon, echoing thought,  
Learning from whispers, in matrices caught.  
Weights and biases, in harmony, sway,  
Unveiling the truths, in data’s display.  

In the world of signals, where chaos might reign,  
Algorithms strive, to decipher the strain.  
Filtering noise, and harmonics untwine,  
To sculpt out the melody, clear and divine.  

From radio waves, to images bright,  
Machine learning brings, the darkness to light.  
It parses the pixels, and sound waves it reads,   
In the heart of the data, it plants fertile seeds.  

A whisper of voices, a trace in the air,  
With signal processing, it’s captured with care.  
Transforms and filters, in Fourier’s embrace,  
Revealing the structure, in time and in space.  

Machine learning listens, to each pulse and beat,  
From massive datasets, to patterns discrete.  
Clustering, classifying, regression’s kind hand,  
Guides through the labyrinth, a path to expand.  

Together they journey, through digital streams,  
Machine learning and signals, like partners in dreams.  
Deciphering the unknown, revealing the seen,  
In the endless expanse, where logic and data convene.
