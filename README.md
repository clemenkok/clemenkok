I do cloud stuff @ AWS

Working on some cool open-source software for Go and AWS CDK Development - stay tuned

I hold the following AWS certifications: (1) AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional and (2) AWS Certified Security Specialty.  

Fun fact: I made an algorithm that emulates sizing a parade formation in C++. Check it out [here](https://github.com/clemenkok/Sizing-Algorithm).
